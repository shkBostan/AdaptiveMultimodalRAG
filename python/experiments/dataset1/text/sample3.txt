Embedding models convert text, images, and audio into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a popular text embedding model that understands context by reading text in both directions.

These embeddings enable similarity search, where documents with similar meanings are located near each other in the vector space. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a library optimized for efficient similarity search in large-scale vector databases.
