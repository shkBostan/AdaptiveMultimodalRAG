Multimodal learning involves processing and understanding information from multiple data types such as text, images, and audio. In the context of RAG systems, multimodal approaches enable more comprehensive information retrieval by considering different modalities simultaneously.

For decision-centric systems, multimodal RAG can provide richer context by combining textual documents, visual data, and audio recordings. This leads to more informed decisions based on comprehensive information analysis.
